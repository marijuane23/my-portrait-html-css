		Forever Yours,
		From the moment our paths entwined,
		I knew my heart was yours to find.
		Through highs and lows, I stand so true,
		Every beat, my love for you.

		I've walked through storms, embraced the rain,
		Held your burdens, felt your pain.
		Not once did I let go or stray,
		For you, my love, in every way.

		Through whispered dreams and endless nights,
		I’ve fought for us with all my might.
		No distance, doubt, nor fleeting time,
		Could break this bond—your heart is mine.

		Loyal as the stars that shine,
		I vow to love you for all time.
		Not just today, not just for show,
		But every day, my love will grow.

		So on this Valentine's, hear me say,
		I choose you now and every day.
		No force could shake the love we share,
		Forever yours—beyond compare.
